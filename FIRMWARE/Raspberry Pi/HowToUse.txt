To run the program, use command:

python sequence.py <name of network>

Replace <name of network> with a name you want to use to signify the 
new network you are creating.

If you wish to use a previous network to detect faults use command:

python detectFaults.py <name of network>

again, replacing <name of network> with the name of the network you want to
test.
